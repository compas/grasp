         General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package:
             GRASP2018 - an F95  development version

=======================================================================

This package is a major revision of the previous GRASP2K package by
P. Jonsson, G. Gaigalas, J. Bieron, C. Froese Fischer, and I.P. Grant
Computer Physics Communication, 184, 2197 - 2203 (2013) written in
FORTRAN 77 style with COMMON and using Cray pointers for memory
management.  The present version is a FORTRAN95 translation using
standard FORTRAN for memory management.  In addition, COMMONS have
been replaced with MODULES, with some COMMONS merged. Some algorithms
have been changed to improve performance for large cases and
efficienty.

The previous package, was an extension and modification of
GRASP92 by Farid Parpia, Charlotte Froese Fischer, and Ian Grant.
Computer Physics Communication, 94, 249-271 (1996)

Development of this package was performed largely by:

                   STRUCTURE OF THE PACKAGE

The package has the structure shown below where executables, after sucessful
compilation, reside in the bin directory. Compiled libraries are in the lib
directory. Scripts for example runs and case studies are in folders under
grasptest. Source code is in the src directory and divided into applications
in the appl directory, libraries in the lib directory and tools in the tool
directory.
