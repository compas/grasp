!>This module stores all the root-mean square radii (rrms) of atomic nuclei that were tabulated by (Angeli et al.)
!! as a function of the atomic number Z and atomic mass A.
!!
!! When values are not available the defaut formula is taken to be
!!
!!         rrms = 0.836*a**(1/3) + 0.570
!!
!! shown to be a good approximation for Z < 91 by (Johnson et al.)

    Implicit none
    !>the number of atoms in the table ordered by atomic number
    Integer, parameter :: n_atoms = 120
    !>a parameter that defines the range of atomic masses (a_min, a_min +n_range -1)to be incuded
    Integer, parameter :: n_range = 35
    !>For each atomic number, the smallest atomic mass for a given nuclear charge included in the Angeli et al. table
    Integer  :: a_min(n_atoms)
    !>For each atomic number, the largest atomic mass for a given nuclear charge included in the Angeli et al. table
    Integer  :: a_max(n_atoms)
    !>an array containing the tabulated values of rrms, such that,
    !!
    !!      for 0 < j <= n_range,
    !!
    !!      rr(z, j) = rrms(z, a_min(z) + j-1)
    !!
    !!A value of 0.0000 is stored for values of j when the corresponding rrms has not been tabulated.
