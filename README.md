# General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package

**GRASP2018 - an F95  development version**

[![][manual-badge]][manual-pdf]

This version of GRASP is a major revision of the previous GRASP2K package by [P.
Jonsson, G. Gaigalas, J. Bieron, C. Froese Fischer, and I.P. Grant Computer
Physics Communication, 184, 2197 - 2203 (2013)][grasp2k-2013] written in FORTRAN
77 style with COMMON and using Cray pointers for memory management.  The present
version is a FORTRAN95 translation using standard FORTRAN for memory management.
In addition, COMMONS have been replaced with MODULES, with some COMMONS merged.
Some algorithms have been changed to improve performance for large cases and
efficiently.

The previous package, was an extension and modification of GRASP92 by [Farid
Parpia, Charlotte Froese Fischer, and Ian Grant. Computer Physics Communication,
94, 249-271 (1996)][grasp92-1996].

This version of GRASP has been published in:

## Structure of the Package

The package has the structure shown below where executables, after successful
compilation, reside in the `bin` directory. Compiled libraries are in the `lib`
directory. Scripts for example runs and case studies are in folders under
`grasptest`. Source code is in the `src` directory and divided into applications
in the `appl` directory, libraries in the `lib` directory and tools in the
`tool` directory.
